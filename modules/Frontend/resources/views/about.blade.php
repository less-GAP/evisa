                        <span class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">Throughout his NFL career, two-time
                            Super
                            Bowl Champion Marc Wilson learned to play hurt. Because as a professional football player,
                            you’re
                            always playing hurt. The bumps and bruises and aches and pains are a given.</span><span
                            class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">Between the lines, though, Marc always
                            showed up for his team.</span><span
                            class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">Like
                            Marc, we’re continuously showing up for our “teams” too — family, friends, even ourselves. And
                            without 300-pound defensive lineman chasing us down from behind, there’s no reason to have to
                            play
                            hurt.</span><span class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">Yet, many of us
                            aren’t
                            taking our health and nutrition seriously, precluding us from performing optimally when it
                            matters
                            most.</span><span class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">As a retired
                            quarterback, Marc understands what it takes to be become the best. And it starts by feeling our
                            best.</span>

                    <span class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">After retiring from the NFL and
                        pursuing a
                        successful career in real estate development, Marc continued to draw on the importance of better
                        health and wellness and how that affects performance.</span><span
                        class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">Performance as a parent, in
                        professional
                        pursuits, and in the hobbies and activities that drive us.</span><span
                        class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">After meeting with experts in health
                        and
                        science, Marc realized that adequate nutrition had become a serious problem in our modern
                        society.
                        Too many places to be, too many things to do, and too many unhealthy options.</span><span
                        class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">His unquenchable thirst for making a
                        difference led him back into the business world.</span>

                        2012,
                        Marc has championed the initiative of greater health and wellness with revolutionary
                        advancements in
                        nutrition and delivery.</span><span

                        “Q” in Q Sciences stands for “Quintessential,” meaning the best of the best, the perfect
                        embodiment
                        of something, including our unmatched nutritional supplements and targeted self-care
                        solutions.</span><span class="block mb-4 dtNUbu">Throughout his
                        career as a professional athlete and successful businessman, Marc never settled for the status
                        quo.
                        Now, he’s helping spread that “Quintessential Lifestyle” so everyone can feel and perform at
                        their
                        very best.</span>
